# cProjects
# A c program that allows for the entry and maintenance of cruise entries and summaries. 
It allows for information such as:
- Cruise Length
- Cruise Price
- Cruise Summary
- Destinations

It also has terminal based interface for the user to interact with to query the data. It includes sorting and a
handful of filters/search mechanisms to make querying the data as efficient as possible. 

# Please feel free to review the code!
